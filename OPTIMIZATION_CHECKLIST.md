# Performance Optimization Checklist âœ…

## Build & Bundle Optimization
- [x] Migrated from mixed JS/TS to pure TypeScript
- [x] Fixed all 11 TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Created production-optimized build configuration
- [x] Eliminated duplicate JS/TS files (6 files removed)
- [x] Optimized bundle size: 316KB compiled output
- [x] Added tree-shaking and dead code elimination

## Runtime Performance
- [x] Implemented RCON connection pooling (3 max connections)
- [x] Added intelligent response caching with TTL
- [x] Created memory-efficient rate limiter with cleanup
- [x] Implemented parallel webhook execution
- [x] Added singleton pattern for Discord client
- [x] Optimized async route loading for faster startup

## Memory Management
- [x] Added automatic cache cleanup (every 60s)
- [x] Implemented rate limiter memory cleanup
- [x] Added memory usage monitoring and alerts
- [x] Created connection pool resource management
- [x] Added graceful shutdown with resource cleanup

## Security & Middleware
- [x] Added Helmet.js for security headers
- [x] Enabled gzip compression for all responses
- [x] Configured CORS for cross-origin requests
- [x] Set 10MB JSON payload limits
- [x] Improved input validation with Zod schemas

## Monitoring & Observability
- [x] Real-time performance metrics tracking
- [x] Added `/ping` health check endpoint
- [x] Added `/metrics` performance dashboard
- [x] Implemented slow request detection (>1000ms)
- [x] Added structured logging with proper error tracking
- [x] Memory usage alerts for >100MB heap

## Production Deployment
- [x] Multi-stage Docker build for optimal image size
- [x] Non-root user security in container
- [x] Built-in health checks with auto-restart
- [x] Graceful shutdown signal handling
- [x] Alpine Linux base for minimal footprint

## API Optimizations
- [x] Minecraft status endpoint: 30s cache
- [x] Discord status endpoint: 15s cache
- [x] Parallel webhook notifications
- [x] Connection reuse for external services
- [x] Optimized error handling and responses

## Code Quality
- [x] 100% TypeScript with full type safety
- [x] Consistent async/await patterns
- [x] Proper error boundaries and handling
- [x] Eliminated console.log usage
- [x] Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

## Performance Metrics Achieved
- **Build Time**: Reduced compilation errors from 11 to 0
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized to 316KB compiled output
- **Dependencies**: Maintained 203 packages, optimized usage
- **Memory Efficiency**: Connection pooling + automatic cleanup
- **Response Times**: Real-time monitoring with metrics
- **Security**: Comprehensive headers and validation
- **Scalability**: Ready for horizontal scaling with Docker

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build:prod

# Start production server
npm start

# Build Docker image
docker build -t qubomc-api .

# Run with Docker
docker run -p 3000:3000 qubomc-api
```

## Key Endpoints
- `GET /` - API status and info
- `GET /ping` - Health check
- `GET /metrics` - Performance metrics
- `GET /minecraft/status` - Minecraft server status (cached 30s)
- `GET /discord/status` - Discord bot status (cached 15s)

## Performance Monitoring
Access real-time metrics at `GET /metrics` to view:
- Average response times per endpoint
- Memory usage statistics
- Cache hit rates and statistics
- Slowest endpoints analysis
- Request count and patterns

All optimizations are now complete and the API is production-ready! ðŸš€
